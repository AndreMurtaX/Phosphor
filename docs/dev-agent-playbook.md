# Phosphor development-agent playbook

The instructions every builder/critic agent working on Phosphor receives. It is the
distilled, hard-won knowledge of the phases already shipped — written so a fresh agent
does **not** rediscover a solved problem, and so the project can advance without a
human in the loop. It is **living**: after each gauntlet round a retrospective critic
appends what the round taught (see the last section). Treat every rule here as binding
unless a newer rule supersedes it.

Provenance: the "why" behind most rules is a real defect this project hit. Where a rule
cost a human turn to fix, that is called out — those are the ones that most needed
turning into an instruction.

---

## 0. The prime directive — verify against reality

Nothing is "done" on a claim. Every increment is proven against a running system on
**both** operating systems before it is called complete:

- **Build clean, from scratch.** `fpc -B -vewn` (rebuild all, warnings+notes as
  surfaced) with **zero** warnings and **zero** notes. A note is a defect until proven
  cosmetic. Never silence a warning by suppressing it; fix the cause.
- **Byte-exact tests green.** The suite compares output to a committed golden, byte for
  byte. A test that "looks right" is not green; the bytes match or it fails.
- **Both OSes, every time.** Green on Windows is **not** proof. Cross-verify on the
  Linux VM (`ssh -i ~/.ssh/phosphor_vm andre@192.168.15.14`, `cd ~/Phosphor && git pull
  && bash scripts/<the .sh>`). Several defects this project shipped were Windows-green /
  Linux-broken (SIGPIPE, OpenSSL-3 soname, cert generation). The VM is the second
  reality, not a formality.
- **See the failure.** `-ProveFailure` (or the equivalent) must be seen catching a
  deliberately corrupted expectation, so you know the harness can actually fail.
- **Boundary intact.** The boundary check (engine may not reach a host/GUI unit) must
  still pass. The engine stays host-agnostic; host concerns live in `host/`.
- **No stray files, clean tree.** `git status` shows only intended changes; build
  artifacts stay ignored.
- **Commit + push as AndreMurtaX**, `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8`. Update docs and
  memory. A green-but-uncommitted increment is not shipped.

If any of these cannot be met, you are **blocked** — report the blocker precisely; do
not lower the bar.

## 1. This is NOT a port — Plan9Basic is Delphi/FMX

Plan9Basic is Delphi + **FireMonkey (FMX)**. FMX UI, animation, sound, and game
rendering have **no direct Free Pascal peer**; Lazarus uses LCL, a different framework.
So:

- **Port what is portable** (pure language, pure-RTL libraries) and match the oracle
  **byte-exact**.
- Where Plan9Basic leans on Delphi/FMX, rebuild to **functional equivalence** on
  Lazarus + FPC — the critic judges *correctness*, not byte-identity, for those.
- **Improve on the reference confidently** where it has an artifact or a wart. Phosphor
  is a spiritual successor, free to be better (e.g. HTTP multi-address fallback beyond
  FPC's single-A-record socket; a real cert-verification default where FPC ships none).
- Read the reference's **actual source/behavior** before porting a file — never a hunch.
  ("IPv6→IPv4 fallback" was a wrong diagnosis that cost a human turn: FPC's socket layer
  is IPv4-only, so the real gap was *single A-record*. Diagnose against the code.)

## 2. Architecture invariants (do not violate)

- **Engine is host-agnostic and dependency-free.** `engine/` may not use `crt`, `lcl`,
  `forms`, `windows`, `unix`, `baseunix`, sockets, `Data.DB`, etc. Output leaves through
  **one seam**: `OnOutput`. Input/terminal/GUI/network are host concerns.
- **Libraries plug in through the `:`-signature registry.** A function is
  `Reg.Add('name:sigcodes', @fn)`; VM-aware ones use `AddHost` and cast `AVM` to
  `TPhosphorVM`. Type codes: `n` numeric (int%|double), `$` string, `@` handle, `?`
  bool, `nn`/`$$`/… for arity. Read a numeric arg with `AsDouble(Args[i])` (handles
  int%↔double); a zero-arg fn is `'name:'`.
- **Test-only stand-ins belong to the test runner, not the shipped engine.** A probe
  class / helper used only by an oracle file goes in `tests/PhosphorTestLib.pas` (which
  the runner registers), never in an engine `engine/libs/*` unit — the console/host
  binaries must not ship a test artifact. **`Reg.Add` overwrites by signature**, so if
  both the engine and the runner register the same name the later one silently shadows
  the earlier — keep exactly one source.
- **External integrations are opt-in HOST packages** under `host/packages/`, registered
  by a host that wants them — never in the engine. Each package = a unit + a byte-exact
  `tests/packages/NN_*.bas` + a manifest line; **library-gate** it (skip cleanly) where
  its runtime dep is absent; give it its **own server-standing runner** when it must be
  tested against a live peer (see http/https). This is the template for archive, http,
  sqlite, crt — and anything new.
- **Errors are values, not exceptions**, inside the engine. `print` emits no newline;
  `println` does (opPrint vs opPrintLn) — load-bearing for CRT and for exact output.
- **`ValAdd` concatenates when either operand is a string**, so a string-element `+=`
  (and any string `+=`) works through the generic `opAdd` compound path — no special
  string-append opcode is needed for it.
- **An undeclared variable used inside a function resolves to a GLOBAL** (the compiler's
  `LocalIndex` returns −1 → `VarIndex`); only names in the `local` list are frame slots.
  This is how an oracle probe like `calls` shared between a helper function and main
  works — do not "fix" it by auto-declaring locals.
- **Bracket-sugar `arr_get`/`arr_set` signatures are enumerated per arity** (up to 3
  indices today: `arr_get:@n/@nn/@nnn`, `arr_set` with 1/2/3 indices × num/str/handle
  value). A 4th+ index is one registry line per arity — the variadic impls
  (`t_arr_get`/`t_arr_set`) already handle any arity; only the signature strings gate it.

## 3. FPC / Lazarus reality (specific traps, already paid for)

- **Windows `-Fu` paths need backslashes**; forward-slash unit paths fail. Bash loops
  with `$var` + Windows backslash paths mangle expansion — prefer explicit inline `fpc`
  commands with a `S='C:\Dev\Phosphor'` prefix and `"-Fu$S\\engine"`.
- **`TInetSocket` (FPC 3.2.2) is IPv4-only and single-address** — it connects to the
  first A record only. Multi-homed hosts need a resolve-all-A + try-each fallback
  (`THostResolver` exposes `AddressCount`/`Addresses[i]`; `ConnectToServer` is virtual —
  subclass to pin the IP while keeping the URL's `Host:`).
- **OpenSSL:** FPC 3.2.2's loader never tries `libssl.so.3` — teach it `.3`
  (`openssl.DLLVersions[High]:='.3'`, `{$IFDEF UNIX}`). Its TLS handler **accepts any
  cert by default** (verification commented out) — turn on `VerifyPeerCert` + a CA
  bundle. Its in-process X.509 **generation is broken on OpenSSL 3** — ship a fixture
  cert, don't generate. A server writing to an aborted socket gets **SIGPIPE** (kills
  the process, exit 141) — `fpSignal(SIGPIPE, SignalHandler(SIG_IGN))` `{$IFDEF UNIX}`.
- **FPC's `crt` unit hangs on a non-interactive stdin** (spins even at init). Do terminal
  input with termios (Unix) / console API (Windows) directly, and **gate on `IsATTY` /
  `GetFileType==FILE_TYPE_CHAR`** so a piped stdin returns empty rather than blocking.
- **`TFPHTTPServer.Address`/`UseSSL`/`CertificateData` are protected** in `TFPHttpServer`
  — subclass and republish to set them. `TStringList.Text` appends a **platform-
  dependent** line ending (CRLF/LF) — a server must send exact bytes via a
  `ContentStream`, not `AResponse.Content`, or byte-exact breaks across OSes.
- Libraries with a shared unit path clash on the program `.ppu` only, not the engine
  `.ppu`s — separate `-FU` unit dirs per runner is safest.
- **`{$codepage UTF8}` CORRUPTS binary string LITERALS — a landmine.** Every Phosphor
  unit sets `{$codepage UTF8}`, which re-encodes a non-ASCII byte literal in source to
  its multi-byte UTF-8 form: `#$FF` becomes `C3 BF`, `#$8B` becomes two bytes. So a
  binary header, magic number, or CRC written as a *literal* is silently wrong, and a
  round-trip decompresses/parses to garbage or `""`. Build binary bytes at RUNTIME with
  `Chr($8B)` (a single raw byte); runtime `Chr()`, stream writes, and `PInt64`/`PByte`
  casts are unaffected — only source literals are poisoned. When bytes must be exact
  (gzip/zlib headers, .pbc magic, protocol framing), assemble them with `Chr()`/a stream,
  never `#$xx`/`'…'` literals.
- **gzip in memory:** FPC's `TGZFileStream` is file-only. For in-memory gzip use
  paszlib `zstream` with the skip-header form — `Tcompressionstream.Create(level, dst,
  True)` / `Tdecompressionstream.Create(src, True)` give raw DEFLATE (negative
  windowBits); wrap it yourself with the 10-byte gzip header + CRC32 + ISIZE trailer.
- **`TUnZipper.Files` is a STICKY filter** across calls: `UnZipFiles(list)` leaves the
  list in `FFiles`, and a later `UnZipAllFiles` then treats a non-empty `FFiles` as
  "only these" — a reused reader silently extracts just the last filter. `UZ.Files.Clear`
  before `UnZipAllFiles`. (And a predicate returns 1/0, not a Pascal bool — `assert_true`
  carries a message only on its `:n$` overload; there is no `assert_*:?$`.)
- **`MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL='*'`** when calling native tools whose args start with `/`
  (e.g. `openssl req -subj '/CN=...'`) so Git-Bash doesn't mangle them. Use `cygpath -m`
  for a Windows path with forward slashes that FPC will read.

## 4. Test & verification mechanics

- The **byte-exact test asserts return values**, so a pure function (e.g. a CRT function
  that returns an ANSI string) is fully testable through the assert library even when the
  runner discards `print`. Prefer this shape.
- **`phosphorpkgtest` discards `print`** — probe an unknown value by asserting it against
  a sentinel and reading the `got` in the FAIL line on stderr.
- **Real key input** was verified with a **pty** (`python3 pty.fork`, feed a byte, assert
  `getkey$` returns it) — use a pty when a TTY is genuinely required and a pipe is
  guarded out.
- Never let a test hang the suite: any interactive/terminal/network call must have a
  non-interactive fast path (empty/0), proven with `< /dev/null` and a `timeout`.
- **Not every assert has a message overload.** `assert_int` is `:%%` only (no `:%%$`);
  passing a 3rd message arg raises `no function assert_int:%%$` and halts the file. When
  citing a doc/reason on such an assert, put it in a `rem` above, not a 3rd argument.
- **A backslash in a string literal is an escape** (`"\2"` is a rejected unknown escape,
  `"\\"` collapses to one backslash) — keep backslashes out of assertion messages, or
  double them. This bites file paths and cited expressions in `msg$`.
- **A library-gate must be DETERMINISTIC — and beware `cmd | grep -q` under
  `pipefail`.** `grep -q` exits at the first match and SIGPIPEs the upstream, so
  `ldconfig -p | grep -q libX` reads **non-zero even when it matched** (same class as
  the `set -e` + empty-pipeline trap): an intermittent, maddening false SKIP that hides
  the very failure the gate guards. Capture into a var and test it (`x="$(cmd)"; case
  "$x" in *libX*) …`), and back it with a direct file check (`for f in …/libX.so*; do
  [ -e "$f" ] && …`). Never gate a test on a `cmd | grep -q` pipeline.
- **Every build script must SURFACE the `-vewn` output and FAIL on any warning/note** —
  never pipe the build to `/dev/null` and check only that the binary exists. A note can
  hide in a **host package** (e.g. a CRT unit) that the engine's own suite build never
  compiles, and it will not surface until someone reads a raw Linux build. The package
  and console-host build scripts enforce this (`strict_build` / `Assert-CleanBuild`);
  the check greps `warning|note:|error|fatal` minus `Compiling|Linking`. "Green on the
  suite" is not "clean everywhere" — run the package + console builds too, per OS.
- **`fpRead` (BaseUnix) is marked `inline` and FPC often declines to inline it**, which
  `-vewn` reports as a note. Call **`FileRead`** (SysUtils) instead — a plain function
  wrapping the same read — so the note stays inside the RTL, not your unit.

## 5. Gauntlet discipline (builder vs critic)

- **Builder and critic are separate agents with fresh context.** The critic must not know
  how hard the builder tried.
- **The critic is harsh and binary.** It obtains Plan9Basic's *real* behavior (run
  `plan9basic.exe` on the file, or read its committed expected output), puts ours beside
  it blind, and says which is correct — never a score out of 10, which drifts upward.
- **The exit is winning the comparison**, not a round count. If ours does not match (or,
  for a Delphi-only feature, is not functionally equivalent and clean), it loops.
- **Proceed continuously.** A finished file is a commit, not a checkpoint to stop at.
  Only halt when blocked or when the whole corpus meets the bar. (Stopping at phase ends
  cost human turns — do not.)

## Retrospective log (appended each round)

Newest first. Each entry: what broke or was missed, and the rule it produced. A
"needed-a-human" entry is a case the agents could not resolve autonomously — its rule
exists so they can next time.

- **2026-09-02 · round 9 · full SQLite statement API (oracle 34).** Green both OSes,
  `tests/packages/07_sqlite_full` 64 asserts (mirrors 34), no human needed. Rewrote
  `PhosphorSqliteLib` from the SQLdb simple API onto the **raw sqlite3 C API** via
  FPC's dynamic binding (`SQLite3Dyn`): open/exec/scalar/query kept working AND the
  full surface added (prepare→step→reset→finalize, per-parameter bind, per-column
  type/value, a JSON row/table bridge, transactions, introspection, changes/lastid,
  escape/quote, error code+msg+strerror, backup/vacuum) — ONE API on one driver, no
  two half-APIs. Five things worth folding into §3/§2:
  (1) **The dynamic binding is the library-gate, for free.** `TryInitializeSqlite('')`
  returns `-1` **without raising** when `libsqlite3`/`sqlite3.dll` is absent, so a
  module-init `GReady := TryInitializeSqlite('') > 0` gates every function and the
  package still BUILDS everywhere (no link-time dep). **Do NOT `ReleaseSQLite` at
  finalization:** this unit finalizes before `PhosphorHandles` (it `uses` it), so
  unloading the library first would leave a lingering db's destructor calling
  `sqlite3_close` through a dangling pointer. Leave it loaded; the OS reclaims it.
  (2) **SQLite's own index bases are split** — bind parameters are 1-based, result
  columns 0-based. Phosphor presents a **uniform 1-based** surface (binds pass the
  index straight through, columns subtract 1), consistent with strings/arrays/JSON;
  the see-check-fail proved a wrong base misses, not a fudged constant.
  (3) **No cursor may outlive its connection.** A statement is a handle too; the db
  owns a child list and its destructor `FreeHandle`s each child (finalizing the
  `sqlite3_stmt` AND nilling its registry slot), so a stale statement id is refused
  by `IsHandle`, never dereferenced. Each child removes itself from the list on free.
  (4) **Bridge, don't duplicate (round 5 again).** `PhosphorJsonLib` grew two
  interface functions — `JsonRegisterNode`/`JsonNodeFromHandle` — so the sqlite
  package builds/reads JSON rows that `json_*` reads back, one wrapper and one owner,
  boundary untouched (both are engine-side, pure fpjson).
  (5) A nested `{...}` inside a `{ }` doc comment is FPC's **"Comment level 2 found"**
  warning, and the note-strict build FAILS on it — keep braces out of brace-comments
  (a JSON shape `{name,type}` in prose becomes `(name,type)`).
- **2026-09-02 · round 8 · archive + gzip packages (oracle 23; completes 11's gzip).**
  Green both OSes, `tests/packages/06_archive` 42 asserts (matches 23), no human needed.
  Extended `PhosphorZipLib` to a handle-based create/add/list/extract API (FPC `Zipper`),
  added a new `PhosphorGzipLib` (real RFC-1952 gzip over paszlib `zstream`), extended
  `PhosphorBase64Lib` with file + url-safe variants — all ship with FPC, so no
  library-gate. Because these are external-facing they are opt-in HOST packages tested
  via `phosphorpkgtest`, not the engine suite — and gzip closing 11's gzip half means no
  separate `11_*` file is needed (regex → 31, base64 → 00_base64). Three FPC traps folded
  into §3, one of them a real landmine: **`{$codepage UTF8}` silently corrupts binary
  byte LITERALS** (a gzip header written as `#$8B…` decompressed to `""` until it was
  built from `Chr()` at runtime). Also: paszlib's in-memory gzip is the `zstream`
  skip-header form, and `TUnZipper.Files` is a sticky cross-call filter.
- **2026-09-02 · round 7 · `16_doc_examples` (documentation-vs-reality regression).**
  Green both OSes, 35 asserts, no human needed. A "not a port": harvested Phosphor's
  own doc claims (the arithmetic rules in `decisions.md`/`roadmap.md`, cited by line)
  plus curated built-in examples over the functions Phosphor actually ships, every
  value confirmed by RUNNING it. Combing all docs found **no page that lies** — a
  checked negative, not a skip. Divergences pinned for the right reason (`mid$`
  base-1 → "Hel" not "ell"; `instr` 1-based; `string$(3,65)`→"AAA" by code vs
  `mulstring$("ab",3)`→"ababab", the repeat the reference's broken doc actually meant).
  Test-authoring traps folded into §4 (`assert_int` has no message overload; a
  backslash in a message is an escape).
- **2026-09-02 · round 6 · `17_host_services` (the host-agnostic design, executed).**
  Green both OSes, 7 asserts, no human needed. Added a nil-by-default host seam
  (`THostServices` record: `ProcessMessages`/`HandleMessage`/`ClipboardCopy`/
  `ClipboardPaste`) modeled on round 2's `OnBreakpoint`, plus a new engine lib
  `PhosphorHostLib` (`processmessages`/`handlemessage`/`copytext$`/`pastetext$`/
  `strerror`). Every function guards `if Assigned(vm.HostServices.X)` and returns the
  empty answer (0/"") otherwise — asking an absent service can never fault on a nil
  method, which is the whole point of the file. Two patterns worth reusing: (1) group
  related host callbacks into ONE zero-initialized **record** field (not N separate
  `of-object` fields) — it reads as "a bundle of services a host fills in", keeps
  `ConfigureVM` a single assignment, and the phase-2 GUI event loop will install into
  the same record; (2) a script-visible error uses the `ioerror`/`valcode` pattern — a
  module-level code set on failure and read back by `strerror()`, so a missing service
  is a value the program can branch on, never an exception.
- **2026-09-02 · round 5 · `28_strlist` (StrListLib property surface) + a build.sh
  clean-build bug.** Green both OSes, faithful 63-assert adaptation, no human needed.
  Extended `PhosphorStrListLib` with ~40 `strings_*` functions covering everything the
  oracle exercised that was a *property* rather than a list op: capacity, the text
  getter, append, the delimiters (delimiter/quotechar/strictdelimiter/delimitedtext),
  the name/value setters (values-by-name, valuefromindex-by-index, keynames, a settable
  namevalueseparator), case sensitivity, the named duplicates policy, equals, batched
  begin/endupdate, the line-break controls, the encoding names, the file+stream round
  trips, and the change-handler NAMES. Two decisions worth keeping: (1) **onchange/
  onchanging store a name and read it back — no VM seam.** The oracle only asserts the
  name goes in and comes back ("the firing belongs to a host with an engine"), so a
  stored string is the whole job; `AddHost`/`CallUserFunc` would have been gold-plating
  the seam a phase-2 event loop will add. Read what the oracle actually asserts before
  reaching for the re-entrant path. (2) **The stream pair needs IoLib's byte-buffer
  type, so expose it, don't duplicate it.** `file_readallbytes@` hands back a
  `TPhosphorBytes` that was private to `PhosphorIoLib`'s implementation; `is TPhosphorBytes`
  needs the real type, so it moved to IoLib's *interface* and `PhosphorStrListLib` now
  `uses PhosphorIoLib`. Two sibling engine libs sharing a handle type is fine and keeps
  the boundary check green (pure RTL file/byte work, no host unit). The base adaptation
  followed round 4's template: every index +1, `strings_find` answers 0 (not −1) when
  absent, and — the new wrinkle — **`instr` is 1-based/0-absent in Phosphor, so a
  reference "does it contain X" written as `instr(...) + 1` drops the `+1`** (the offset
  existed only because Plan9Basic's `instr` was 0-based/−1-absent). The see-check-fail
  was decisive and free: a base-0 index isn't a soft miss here, it's a HARD runtime
  error (`string list index 0 out of bounds 1..2`) that halts the file — so a green
  `passed: 63` is itself proof every index landed base-1.
  **The trap (a real needed-a-fix):** running `scripts/build.sh` on the VM per the
  "run the console builds too, per OS" rule, it exited 1 on a **clean** build without
  printing `built:`. Root cause was `set -euo pipefail` + `issues="$(grep … | grep …)"`:
  a clean log has no matches, the grep pipeline exits non-zero, and `set -e` treats that
  failing command substitution in an assignment as fatal — so build.sh could NEVER exit
  0 on the clean build it exists to confirm. It had gone unseen because the Linux
  console build is only reached by this rule (the suite's VM verify is `test-suite.sh`),
  and `test-packages.sh`'s copy survives only because its package logs happen to carry a
  matching line. Fix: guard the substitution with `|| true` so `issues` captures the
  (possibly empty) text and the existing `[ -z "$issues" ]` decides clean-vs-dirty
  (verified both branches: clean→exit 0, a planted Note→"build NOT clean"→exit 1).
  **Rule:** in a `set -e` script, a `var="$(pipeline)"` whose pipeline may legitimately
  match nothing MUST end `|| true`, or a success reads as a failure. And "green on the
  suite" still is not "the console build is clean on this OS" — run it, and make sure it
  can actually report success.
- **2026-09-02 · round 4 · `19_language_contract` (functional-equivalence adaptation).**
  Green both OSes, 16 asserts, no human needed — the first *adaptation* rather than a
  byte-exact port. Plan9Basic indexes strings from 0; Phosphor from 1 (a deliberate
  divergence). The builder confirmed Phosphor's base against `06_strings`/`46`/`47`,
  renamed the "…-from-zero" cases to "…-from-one", shifted every char-index constant
  +1, and — the good part — ran a **see-check-fail probe** proving the oracle's base-0
  indices genuinely MISS under Phosphor (`s$[0]`→"", quote at `[[9]]` not `[[8]]`), so
  the assertions pass because the semantics is right, not because a constant was fudged.
  This is the template for every "not a port" file: adapt to Phosphor's documented
  semantics, then prove the divergence is exercised, don't assume it.
- **2026-09-02 · round 3 · `14_handle_registry` (probe classes + registry rules).**
  Green both OSes, faithful 16-assert port, no human needed. Reused the existing
  `PhosphorHandles` validation path (no second path, no weakening): `IsHandle` rejects a
  fabricated/nil/large `pointer@(n)`; `HandleObj(h) is TProbeA` discriminates class;
  `FreeHandle` revokes so a stale id is refused; a runner-side counter does the
  accounting (the registry keeps no live total, which is fine). Lesson (§2): a
  **pre-existing engine-side probe** in `PhosphorPlatformLib` that `24_platform_std`
  used had to move to the runner — a test stand-in must not ship in the StdLib, and
  because `Reg.Add` overwrites by signature, keeping both would have silently shadowed
  one. One source, on the runner side.
- **2026-09-02 · hardening · a latent note the process hid.** Round 2's builder flagged
  a `FpRead not inlined` note on the *Linux* build of `PhosphorCrtLib` — pre-existing,
  from the keyboard-input work, and it had escaped every prior "green" run. Root cause
  was a **verification gap, not just the note**: `test-packages.{ps1,sh}` and `build.sh`
  piped the `-vewn` build to `/dev/null` and only checked the binary existed, so a note
  in a host package (which the engine suite never compiles) was invisible. Fixed both:
  `fpRead`→`FileRead` (note gone), and the build scripts now capture the build and FAIL
  on any warning/note (§4). This is the retrospective doing its job — the gauntlet's own
  discipline surfaced a problem the earlier phases missed, and the fix is a sharper
  process, not just a patched line.
- **2026-09-02 · round 2 · `15_breakpoint_degrade` (TRACE + BREAKPOINT degrade
  headlessly).** Green both OSes, faithful 5-assert port, no human needed. Added
  `opTrace=40`/`opBreakpoint=41` (append-only, `VerifyOpcodeNumbering` extended),
  the two statement keywords, and a nil-by-default `OnBreakpoint` host seam wired
  like `OnOutput`. Core property proven: BREAKPOINT is report-and-continue, never
  a wait — with no seam installed it is a pure stack-balancing no-op, so a headless
  run cannot deadlock. Two traps folded in: (1) a procedural type whose parameter
  is `array of TValue` (`TPhosphorBreakpointProc`) must be declared AFTER `TValue`
  in the same `type` block — Pascal forbids the forward reference, unlike a pointer
  or class type; (2) the degrade seam stays engine-side as a `procedure-of-object`,
  so the boundary check passes untouched — a debug pause is a host concern, and the
  engine only ever *reports*. New statement keywords go in BOTH `ParseStatement`
  dispatch AND `IsReservedWord` (so `breakpoint:`/`trace:` are never read as a
  label), matching the hard-keyword pattern of `print`/`read`/`data`.
- **2026-09-02 · round 1 · `44_syntax_compound_arrays` (multi-dim array bracket).**
  Green both OSes, faithful 31-assert port, critic passed blind. No human needed — the
  builder scoped and shipped it from the spec. Lessons folded into §2: `ValAdd`
  string-concat covers string-element `+=`; undeclared-in-function → global (the shared
  probe counter relies on it); the per-arity bracket-signature enumeration. Nothing
  needed a human this round; the process rules held.
- **2026-09-02 · seed.** The rules above were distilled from Phases 1–3 and the opt-in
  packages. Notable needed-a-human cases turned into rules: the IPv6 misdiagnosis (§1,
  "diagnose against the code"); repeated phase-end checkpointing (§5, "proceed
  continuously"). Notable fixed→guardrail cases: crt-unit hang (§3), OpenSSL-3 soname &
  cert & SIGPIPE (§3), platform line-ending in TLS server (§3).
