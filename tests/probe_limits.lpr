{******************************************************************************
  probe_limits -- a Pascal test of the execution ceilings (phase-3 step 2)

  Limits are a HOST-facing feature: the embedder sets them on TPhosphorEngine
  before Run, so they are tested here from Pascal, the way a host uses them --
  not from a .bas file (the byte-exact runner sets no limits). Each check runs a
  script under a ceiling and asserts the run aborted with peLimit, that a normal
  script within the ceilings runs clean, and that ON ERROR cannot catch a limit.

  ALSO the FRONT END's ceilings and its refusal to read a token that is not
  there, and those are here for a sharper reason than convenience. Each of them
  used to KILL the process -- an access violation on a source file whose first
  character cannot start a token, a stack overflow on a run of prefix operators
  -- and the negative-test harness asks only whether the exit code was non-zero.
  A crash is non-zero. A .bas file therefore could not tell the fix from the bug:
  it would have gone green either way. From Pascal the question is the one an
  embedding host actually asks: Compile must RETURN False and say why, and it
  must not raise.

  Prints "ok: N" / "fail: M" and exits non-zero on any failure. Run with --fail
  to corrupt one expectation and confirm the check can fail.

  { A CEILING CROSSED INSIDE A NESTED ACTIVATION IS STILL FATAL.

    `callfunc` is a library function that re-enters the interpreter, so when the
    body it runs crosses a ceiling, the peLimit travels back to opCall looking
    exactly like a library that returned an error -- and opCall's ON ERROR path
    would have caught it. That was closed by refusing every peLimit at that
    branch, on a grep that found no library producing one.

    One patch later the budget lane gave the libraries their own refusals
    (`string$: that would take 2147483647 units of work`), which are catchable BY
    DESIGN: nothing has been spent and a program that catches one and asks for
    less is behaving correctly. So the code alone can no longer tell the two
    apart, and the VM now discriminates on where the peLimit came from.

    This pins the half that has no other test. Its twin -- a library refusal
    stays catchable -- is pinned by probe_budget's "catching a refusal builds
    nothing" and "a refused write does not poison the next file_copy", which are
    the two that went red when the two patches were first integrated.

    IT IS THE FRAME CEILING AND NOT THE STEP BUDGET ON PURPOSE, and it runs with
    every ceiling at 0 for that reason. FSteps is shared with the outer loop, so
    a step budget crossed inside a callback RE-FIRES one instruction later and
    would be fatal with this rule or without it -- a pin on it passes either way
    and measures nothing. FFrameSP is restored by CallUserFunc, so the frame
    ceiling is the one that genuinely escapes. Measured both ways before this was
    written: with the rule, rc=5 code=7 "call depth limit exceeded (262144
    activation frames)"; with the rule forced False, rc=0 and the program printed
    its continuation line. }

  { --- the front end: a bad FIRST character ---------------------------------
    TLexer.Tokenize gives up the moment it meets a character that cannot start a
    token, so when that character is the first one, not a single token was ever
    pushed. TLexer.Cur's fallback -- FTokens[FCount - 1] -- was then FTokens[-1]
    on a nil array, and copying a TToken out of it also copied its StrVal: String
    field, incrementing a refcount through a wild pointer. TPhosphorCompiler.Fail
    asks Cur().Kind on every failure, so EVERY lexical error at offset 1 came
    through it: `phosphor run` on a file starting with '~' died with an access
    violation instead of printing the error the SAME character prints on line 2,
    `phosphor compile` exited 0 having written nothing, and a UTF-8 BOM -- which
    every Windows editor writes -- killed the REPL on the first line of a piped

    PhosphorValue, and the first operation that made a NaN of it (x - x) raised
    EInvalidOp and killed the process past an `on error goto`. }
